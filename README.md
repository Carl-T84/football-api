Approach:

I decided to use RestAssured and code out the API tests instead of a tool like Postman or Jmeter.

I was able to complete a successful GET request from the football API, however this API does not cater for POST requests so an alternative API was used.

I opted ton set up a Maven project and write the cod in Java. TestNG and RestAssured dependencies also had to be set up.
